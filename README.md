Chess
=====

##How to run

You can run the game by navigating to the 'chess' directory and typing 'game.rb'.

##Board orientation

White starts out on top, which might be a little bit disorienting.

##Known gameplay bugs

Unfortunately, we weren't able to implement en passant, draw by repetition, or draw by agreement. You can do just about anything else, though! (Including castling!)

##Show legal moves

You can show your legal moves (including, because of a bug, the ones that move you into checkâ€¦) by typing the coordinates of that piece without typing a destination. (Make sure your terminal window is tall enough to see the full output.) We think it's a pretty cool feature, despite the bug.

##Quitting

You can quit by typing 'q' in the terminal, or by holding control + c in traditional programmer style.

##ASCII

One day, I may use pretty unicode pictures and the colorize gem to prettify the output. Until that day, you may suffer my ASCII art.
